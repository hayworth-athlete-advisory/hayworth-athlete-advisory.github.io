In addition, Zachary holds a master's degree from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where he pursued an academic track tailored to advanced business studies, sports and law, and the business of sports. At Duke, as well as independently, Zachary has conducted in-depth research and produced numerous reports on athlete representation, financial management for athletes, regulation in sports, and emerging issues within the sports industry.
