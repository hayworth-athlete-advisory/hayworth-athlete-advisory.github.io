						<h3 class="major">About</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 1em">Zachary Hayworth, a certified agent with the National Basketball Players' Association, founded Hayworth Sports Group after a longtime tenure as an entrepreneur. Zachary founded his first business as a teenager and has gained nearly 15 years of experience overseeing managerial, financial, and strategic matters within the company. Following his exit from ownership, Zachary formed a business consulting practice, Hayworth & Co.  Most recently, he founded Hayworth Sports Group to offer a non-traditional approach to representation, management, and advisory for professional athletes. Leveraging his past experiences, Zachary uses heavily tailored approaches, sophisticated analysis, and entrepreneurial principles to create value for today and tomorrow's athletes.   </p>						<p style="font-size: 1em">Over the course of his career, Zachary has received highly specialized training at five different universities. His educational background includes undergraduate degrees in business administration and entrepreneurship with honors from Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey, and a Master of Business Administration in management from the University of Massachusetts.</p>
						<p style="font-size: 1em">In addition, Zachary holds a master's degree from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where he pursued an academic track tailored to advanced business studies, sports and law, and the business of sports. At Duke, as well as independently, Zachary has conducted in-depth research and produced numerous reports on athlete representation, financial management for athletes, regulation in sport, and emerging issues in the sports industry. </p>
						<p style="font-size: 1em">He completed each of his degrees with distinction and highest honors.</p>
