						<p style="font-size: 1em">Zachary Hayworth, a certified agent with the National Basketball Players' Association, founded Hayworth Sports Group after a longtime tenure as an entrepreneur. As a teenager, he started his first business, which grew to become a leader within its industry. Zachary has gained over a decade of experience overseeing managerial, financial, negotiation and strategic matters within his own company. Following his exit from ownership, Zachary formed a business consulting practice, Hayworth & Co., which provides management and advisory services to individuals and organizations. In addition to the offerings of Hayworth Sports Group, all athletes have unlimited access to the resources and expertise of Hayworth & Co. </p>
						<p style="font-size: 1em">Throughout his career, Zachary has received highly specialized training at five different universities. His educational background includes undergraduate degrees in business administration and entrepreneurship with honors from Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey, and a Master of Business Administration in management from the University of Massachusetts. He completed each of his degrees with distinction and highest honors.</p>
						<p style="font-size: 1em">In addition, Zachary holds a master's degree from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where he pursued an academic track tailored to management studies, sports business, and sports law. At Duke, as well as independently, Zachary has conducted in-depth research and produced numerous reports on athlete representation, financial management for athletes, emerging issues in the sports industry, and league regulations.</p>
